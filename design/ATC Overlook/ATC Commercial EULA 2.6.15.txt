Commercial License Agreement*

*If You use any Avondale Type Co. Fonts for commercial/client work, You must purchase a Commercial License.

This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legally binding contract between You and the Avondale Type Company LLC. (“ATC”). When You purchase a Font, You are purchasing the right to use that Font under a particular set of conditions. These conditions range from, for example, how many computers the Font can be installed on to whether it can be embedded in digital documents. It is important to read and understand this Agreement because it defines Your rights, the acceptable uses of our Fonts, and the rights ATC reserves. If You believe Your usage or need is not addressed, or if You are unsure of the meaning of any term or condition, please email us before You purchase.

Downloading, installing or using ATC Fonts indicates Your confirmation that You understand and consent to the terms of this Agreement, and that You have the authority to bind the person or entity specified on Your sales receipt (“licensee”) to the terms of this Agreement. Upon payment in full, ATC grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use our Fonts under the following terms and conditions.

1. Definitions

“You”, “Your” and the “End User” are defined as and refer to a customer who has purchased a license to use the Font. An End User is not defined as a distributor, reseller, dealer, sub-licensee, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”), or other wholesale buyer, etc. ATC products may not be distributed and/or sold to third parties without prior written consent from ATC.
