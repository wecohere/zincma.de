title: Don't Go Chasing Unicorns
excerpt: "To deliver high quality technology services and products we need to
         make space on our teams for people with skills beyond programming, with
         backgrounds beyond MIT, at a variety of skill and experience levels."

The core question when making a hiring decision is "Is this someone who we
believe can provide value to our team and we can trust to do the best they can
with the experiences they have and support they are given?"

Because this question is so hard we frequently fall victim to [the substitution
fallacy](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9l3/the_substitution_principle/). "Does this
person make me feel comfortable? Do they share my views on topics? Do we have
similar experiences?"


As technologists, one of our core failings is hiring. We struggle with two very
difficult things:

* Identifying what mindsets and skills our team needs to be successful.
* Evaluating whether or not someone has those mindsets and skills.


This is made all the more difficult because we:

* Shovel in a bunch of "requirements" from additional jobs.
* Really want someone who somehow matches all of our desires.
* Under-value skills we don't have and over-value skills we have.
* Really really want someone who will like us! (And that we'll like).
