    <h3>What Our Clients Say</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <q>When I was 7, I built a cubby house under a big old tree and made it
      with cardboard boxes.  It rained. The thing couldn't cope and fell
      apart.<br /><br />

      If you want to build something robust, use the resources that set the
      right foundation that will last.<br /><br />

      Zee ensured we didn't build a cardboard cubby house with our product.<br /><br />

      His experience, mentorship and skills in the craft of building solid
      applications set us on the right path.<br /><br />

      Looking forward to working with him again soon.

    <q>Zee is an excellent teacher and
      facilitator of group learning. He is patient and funny
      and asks the right questions to get people thinking.
      He is clearly passionate about programming and
      constantly improving his own skills, and that
      excitement is contagious.I've really enjoyed learning
      Ruby on Rails, TDD, and new ways to think about
      programming challenges from him.</q>

    <q>Zee is one of the more passionate developers I've
      worked with. His work is impeccable, as he takes the
      utmost care to craft it. Zee is great to work with, he
      is patient and explains things well. I thoroughly
      enjoyed pairing with him, and felt he brought a needed
      quality of excellence to our team.</q>
